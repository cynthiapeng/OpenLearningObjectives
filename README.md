# OpenLearningObjectives

## Goals
To accelerate the implementation of high-quality blended 
learning across the country, one of our areas of focus is competency-based 
learning: how exactly does it work? One of the key elements is clear learning 
objectives that are structured to make competency-based learning feasible. 
They must be specific, discrete, and demonstrable. Many learning objectives 
today are not structured in this way, which makes it difficult to use them.

[The Learning Accelerator](http://www.learningaccelerator.org) and [OpenEd](http://opened.com) have partnered  to create a list of specific learning objectives for K-5 mathematics. These objectives are structured  to enable competency-based learning.  They also cover all of the content in the 
Common Core standards for math for these grades.

Our goal is to make these available for free for every teacher 
in the country. We hope this will be helpful for teachers and serve as a starting 
point for them to implement competency-based learning in the months and years ahead. 
And even if teachers don't move in this direction, we hope this list can save teachers 
many hours of work creating the objectives.

## Structure of Open Learning Objectives
The objectives are in the Excel spreadsheets and XML files in this repository. They are grouped by topic area 
(e.g., addition, fractions, etc.). You can click on the little "+" signs on the 
left to open and close the sections. For most of the objectives we have added a 
reference to the Common Core standard the objective aligns with, you can see this 
on the right

## How to View the Learning Objectives 
Check out the XLS spreadsheet and load it in your Excel compatible spreadsheet app.  
  git checkout MathLearningObjectives.xls

## How To Make Contributions and Give Feedback  

Currently checkins are approved by [Brandon Dorman](mailto:brandon@opened.com) and [Scott Ellis](scott.ellis@learningaccelerator.org).  We welcome contributions from the wider education community. 

To give feedback post comments here.  Or fork this repository, check out MathLearningObjectives.xml and load into Excel. Make your changes.  Save As MathLearningObjectives.xml.  Then issue a pull request to us.  By using the XML version GitHub (well really git) will be able to merge your proposed changes with the master copy.  That is multiple contributors can make changes to different parts of the spreadsheet.

## Futures 
We will be expanding this effort to cover Middle School and High School math and K-12 English Language Arts.  We will also be providing an open source API to allow querying the structure of these objectives.   Keep an eye on the page for details. 

## Frequently Asked Questions
* *Why are you using GitHub for this? Why not just post it on a web page?*
While GitHub is primarily used by developers, this allows an easy way for many contributors to collaborate on this project, making it truly open.
* *How is this different from the Common Core State Standards?*
* *Why are you really doing this?*
TLA wants to create clearer learning objectives to enable mastery-based learning.  CCSS isn't quite specific enough (see above).  OpenEd's specialty is standard-aligned resources. In some areas CCSS is not concrete enough to provide well aligned resources.

# OpenLearningObjectives

= Goals= 
To accelerate the implementation of high-quality blended 
learning across the country, one of our areas of focus is competency-based 
learning: how exactly does it work? One of the key elements is clear learning 
objectives that are structured to make competency-based learning feasible. 
They must be specific, discrete, and demonstrable. Many learning objectives 
today are not structured in this way, which makes it difficult to use them.

The Learning Accelerator and OpenEd have partnered  
to create a list of specific learning objectives for K-5 math. These objectives are structured 
to enable competency-based learning.  They also cover all of the content in the 
Common Core standards for math.

Our goal is to make these available for free for every teacher 
in the country. We hope this will be helpful for teachers and serve as a starting 
point for them to implement competency-based learning in the months and years ahead. 
And even if teachers don't move in this direction, we hope this list can save teachers 
many hours of work creating the objectives.

= Structure of Open Learning Objectives =
The objectives are in the attached Excel spreadsheet. They are grouped by topic area 
(e.g., addition, fractions, etc.). You can click on the little "+" signs on the 
left to open and close the sections. For most of the objectives we have added a 
reference to the Common Core standard the objective aligns with, you can see this 
on the right.

= How to View the Learning Objectives =
Check out the XLS spreadsheet and load it in your Excel compatible spreadsheet app.
